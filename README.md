## Scrimba Solo Project - CSS and Semantic HTML with JavaScript Stretch Goals

This project is the culmination of Scrimba Module 4 - Essential CSS Concepts. JavaScript dataset and images were provided by Scrimba. 

Goals of the project were as follows:

- Create the first post (by copy/pasting from the first item of the posts dataset)
- Use semantic HTML (header, main, section and footer). Note: I decided that the footer element was not required for this activity
- Add hover effects to the icons

Stretch goals were as follows:

- Use JavaScript to render out all three posts
- Increase the likes when double clicking the posts

All goals and stretch goals completed, plus localStorage methods.
